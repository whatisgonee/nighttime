			<h1>About this project</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Nighttime is my favourite. The day is busy. Messy. You wake up, shower, eat, go to school/university/the bank to find out that all your finances and possessions have been transferred to an unknown person and discovering that it was you who’s done it, it’s just that you don’t remember what happened the other night/job, meet new people and make new enemies. It is easy to get lost in so many activities that need to be done, things to make, people to call, words to write. And while it is also easy to slow down and sit on a bench in a park and watch people laugh and cry, hug and say goodbye to each other for the last time, the night is much more interesting. A person jogging in the middle of the night is enough for me to create a plot in my head and then turn it into a story. An ambulance, a police car, two people kissing, a person waiting for a bus, anything can spark creativity during the nighttime. Mundane things turn into plots, complete strangers become characters of their lives. The night is calm. Slow. And it stretches to infinity, until the sun breaks the dawn. And that is why I love it. And that is why I created this <a href="/">project</a>.</p>

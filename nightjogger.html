			<p>Nighttime always gives you a sense of dread. The feeling of coming doom. When the sun is down and nothing can shine a light on the dangers that hide within the shadows, only the moon. And the moon is always watching. Observing. Even if you get robbed, even if you get killed, the moon will do nothing but simply float there, above you and watch.<br>Still, tonight you feel an unusual sense of calm. It is calm on the streets as it is always, every night, every hour. Everybody is asleep, only the distant flickering of a plane that is flying above the town. And still, nothing is going wrong. Nothing that would suggest that something is going to go wrong. Your brain, a thing that always panicked whenever the sun went down, is nothing silent. For the first time in your life, you are not afraid of the dark. Maybe it is the darkness itself that got into your soul and brain and eyes and under the skin? Maybe it is the light that still shines in you, even if there is no sun, even if there would be no moon? Maybe you just grew up. The nighttime is not that bad after all.<br>A man jogged past you. An unusual sight to see in the middle of the night, especially for your town. Maybe that man is also enjoying the night, just like you? Maybe he forgot to jog in the morning and thought that a jog before going to bed will help him sleep? In any case, the town is not asleep just yet. The diner is open, as it always is, with you on its stairs that lead to the entrance. And the man who jogged past you is also not asleep. Life continues even when there is no reason to. Life continues even if there is no light that would shine on plants to make them grow. It’s beautiful, isn’t it? The ability not to sleep when you need to.<br>The man jogged past you again. He seems to be running around the block. The diner light showing his face features. His sweaty, red face. His headband. His dark, wide brows. His eyes swiftly glancing at you as he runs by. And you glance at him back. It is a mutual glance. A greeting, of some kind, though you are not sure what this greeting means. Does that mean, “Hey, you’re not asleep too, how cool is that?” or “Hey, why are you not asleep? It’s already midnight”? In any case, it does not matter. Why should it? You greeted each other and that is enough.<br>The moon looks beautiful tonight, doesn’t it? And that plane that is still flying above the little town you live in. Maybe it isn’t a plane after all? Maybe it is a satellite? You wonder how the earth looks from back there. It probably looks small and gorgeous. There, in space, there is no night or day. There is simply vast darkness with balls of flame that float in it seemingly by magic. It probably looks surreal, like being on a stage. Or in a movie. You haven’t seen a movie in a while. Maybe you should. You will probably watch Interstellar again.<br>The man jogged past you. The light still shining bright on his face. Eyes not looking at you, not even glancing. Not even moving. He slowed down and turned around. Then he looked at you and sat down on the steps of the diner. You, with your cup of cold coffee in your hand, and the man who you don’t even know. The night jogger would be an appropriate name for him. At least you think so.<br>You sit there, silent. Not moving, not talking, not even looking at each other. You both stare at the flickering red light in the sky that does not move. Maybe it isn’t a satellite after all. Maybe it is a radio tower, somewhere high on the mountain. You imagine a lonely man sitting in the booth, playing music and chatting with the sleepy town of yours. It is a wonderful job, isn’t it?<br>The man turned his head towards you. You turned your head towards him. You both smiled and then the man stood up and continued running. You will remember this moment. You will remember this night. You know that tomorrow night won’t be special. The feeling of dread and horror will come back, you are sure about that. But just for this quick moment, you are happy. You are in love with the night.</p>

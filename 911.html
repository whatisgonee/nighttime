			<p>“Hello, 911? I found a body on the fifth lane. I think he’s dead. There’s blood coming from his head and…”<br>“911? I need help on road number seven. I found a corpse. Damage to the head, I think. Blood everywhere. We’ll need an ambulance and…”<br>“911? There’s a dead person lying on the ground near my house. There’s blood coming from his head. I think there’s a badge on his shirt. It says: 911 employee…”<br><br>“Unfortunately, all of our operators are busy at the moment. Please standby for a 911 operator to take your call. Thank you.”<br><br>911 is gone. To be exact, 911 is dead. Welcome.<br><br>911 always cared. 911 always was here to help us. We called 911 to cry. We called 911 when we were bored. We called 911 when we needed a hand, an ambulance, an unmarked police van and one million dollars or else the victim would die. But how often did 911 call us? How often did it ask us for help? How often did you tell the 911 operator that it is okay? That everyone, even the bravest, even the most selfless people cry in bed. That everyone has their lowest of lows. That’s right. Never. And now, the emergency line we’ve all loved and trusted is gone. And it is all our fault.<br>But that can’t happen. How can an entire department of civil services simply cease to exist? How can every employee of the 911 emergency line all of a sudden die? That does not make sense. And it shouldn’t make sense. There’s nothing that could have predicted it. Nothing that would show that there was something wrong. They never cried. They never felt bad. At least, we didn’t notice. Yes, they laughed a little bit less. And yes, they may have smiled only when looked at. But everybody has their ups and down. Everybody can feel a bit blue from time to time. Right?<br>And frankly, that is all their fault. They should have reached out. They should have asked for help, like we all do. Like all normal people do. There’s no sense in trying to carry the burden of existence, the burden of helping other people while sacrificing your own health all by yourself. We all suffer, we all suffer from the consequences of being born. And yet we all live, we all cope with it. They should have known that there was something wrong with them, so why didn’t they cry? So why didn’t they ask? So why did they die?<br>…Who are we lying to? It is all our fault. We could have prevented it. If only we knew how to help them. If only we knew they needed help. We were blind, blinded by their kindness and faked happiness. We got used to having a helping hand, a number which we can all dial and complain to. An emergency line that was always there when we needed it. That always listened. That always helped us cry and then soothed us until we fell asleep. If only we looked after it better. If only we cared more. If only we… If only…<br>We can’t make it. We can’t make it without them. The world seems to have lost its meaning now that they’re gone. Is this our punishment? Is this what  they had to go through? Oh god… No sense of fighting when you’ve already lost the match. There’s no sense of trying to swim upwards when you’re already at the bottom. Where is upwards anyway? Where do we go now? What shall we do?<br>What shall we do? What will we do? No one to call to at night. No one’s waiting at home. No one’s made dinner for us. They are gone. And it is all our fault. But through guilt a person can achieve only so much. Action is the engine of our car and guilt is the fuel. We shall take our sorrow, our shame and guilt and we shall drive. And we shall drive until the road ends, until the sun goes down, until the last star in this goddamn universe will die. And then we will say sorry. And then we will cry. And then there would be no one left.<br>911 was with us. It is with us. It will always be. No matter where we are. 911 isn’t a place. It isn’t a thing that’s geographically bound to some building and wires. It isn’t a number that’s only in our phones. It is a number that is in our hearts. And wherever that heart is, whenever it is, the number will always be there. With us.</p>
